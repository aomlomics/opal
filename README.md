## Development Workflow

For feature requests, please raise a GitHub issue. To propose a change:

- Feature branches must be made from **dev** branch [↓ See Development Process](#development-process)

## Quick Start

### Install Dependencies

This will only show you the frontend (with no data). You need to setup a local Postgres Database, OR visit the dev or main website to see the website's full functionality.

After cloning the repository locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm run dev
```

Note: npm install will fail until you do the Local DB setup. You can view the frontend, but it won't have data and won't be very interesting/useful.

### Configure .env File

- You need to create an environment file named .env in the `/frontend` directory.
- This file is required to configure environment variables for the application.
- **See `/frontend/.env.template` to see the required variables and their format.**

## Local Database Setup / Commands

1. Install Postgres DB via [Prisma Postgres guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database)
   - Follow instructions per your system, use default parameters
   - Note your postgres username and password. We recommend username: postgres, password: admin.
2. Create your database using either:

   ```bash
   # In terminal:
   createdb <dbname>

   # Or in psql:
   CREATE DATABASE <dbname>;
   ```

3. To view all local databases in psql:
   ```sql
   \l
   ```
4. Configure your .ENV file. **Please see our Env file section above for more info**:
   - For the local database: `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=postgres://<username>:<password>@localhost/<database_name>?pgbouncer=true&connect_timeout=15`
   - Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<database_name>` with your own.

### Database Commands

Note: All commands must be executed from within `/frontend`.

1. First Time Setup (Fresh Install):

```bash
npx prisma generate        # Creates Prisma Client based on your schema
npx prisma db push        # Creates database tables based on schema
```

2. Schema Changes (Keep Data):

```bash
npx prisma db push        # Updates database schema while preserving existing data
                         # Will fail if changes would cause data loss
```

3. Schema Changes (Can't Keep Data):

```bash
npx prisma db push --force-reset  # Completely resets database, deleting all data
npx prisma db seed               # Re-adds seed data if needed
```

**Important: To populate the local database, you must upload the files in `/testdata` by navigating to the `Submit` tab on the website.** Then click `Submit a Project`.

## Development Process

Feature branches must be made from **dev** branch. Get latest from dev:

```bash
# If you don't have a dev branch yet locally:
git checkout -b dev origin/dev

# If you intend to make a change:
git checkout -b <FeatureBranchName>
git merge dev
```

## Developer Commands

All commands must be executed from within `/frontend`:

Install all node dependencies from package.json:

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
```

Run the local test server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the Prisma database view:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Push schema changes to database (all database migrations should be done in `/frontend`):

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name "<insert migration name>"
```

Pull schema changes from database (must be done in `/server` after creating a migration in `/frontend`):

```bash
npx prisma db pull
```

Clear the database of all entries:

```bash
npx prisma db push --force-reset
```

Generate Prisma Client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

To create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the current version of the database, copy and paste the contents of the schema.dbml file in `frontend/prisma/dbml` to: [DB Diagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d)

## Legacy Documentation

The following sections are no longer in use but maintained for reference:

### To run using Docker:

Build the image and run the image in a container using

```bash
docker build -t node -f server/Dockerfile.dev .; docker run -t -d -p 8080:8080 --name node node
```

This will open our remote server at `localhost:8080`. After running this once, you can use Docker Desktop to manage the container.

To delete the container and image, use

```bash
docker rm --force node; docker rmi node
```

To open the container in VSCode, open the Command Pallette `ctrl + shift + p` and run `Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container` (this requires the Dev Containers extension).

Open the folder `/app/node/server` in the Dev Container.

When opening the first time, VSCode will think every file has been changed (potentially line-termination inconsistencies, not sure). Discard all git changes before starting any work. You should only have to do this once after creating the container.

### Server

The server must be handled inside the Docker container.

To reattach your terminal to the gunicorn process, use

```bash
screen -rd nodeserver
```

To scroll inside the screen (enter copy mode), hit `ctrl+a`, then hit `esc`. When you are in copy mode, you can't see new logs. So, once you are done looking, hit `ctrl+c` to exit copy mode. To detach, hit `ctrl+a`, then hit `d`.

There are helpful `.sh` scripts you can run with the `bash` command in `server/scripts`.
The `restart.sh` script will restart the gunicorn process to allow you to view changes to code.
The `start.sh` script will run the gunicorn process in a screen. Behavior is the same as when you run `attach.sh`.
